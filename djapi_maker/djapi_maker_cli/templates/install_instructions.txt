API Code generated Successfully!
*** However, you still need to add the apps and url routes to your project! ****
Here's what you need to do:
Step 1) Add new apps to Django's INSTALLED_APPS array.
  In your project's settings.py file, there should be something that looks like this:

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        'rest_framework',
        'djapi_maker_cli',
        'django.contrib.admin',
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        'django.contrib.sessions',
        'django.contrib.messages',
        'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    ]

  You need to add {0} to this list, like so:".format(", ".join(db_names)))

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
{% for db_name in db_names %}        '{{db_name}}',{% endfor %}
        'rest_framework',
        'djapi_maker_cli',
        'django.contrib.admin',
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        'django.contrib.sessions',
        'django.contrib.messages',
        'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    ]

Step 2) Add new routers to Django's DATABASE_ROUTERS tuple.
  Also in your project's settings.py file, you need to add a DATABASE_ROUTERS setting like so:

    DATABASE_ROUTERS = (
{% for db_name in db_names %}            '{{db_name}}.router.Router',{% endfor %}
    )

Step 3) Add API URLs to your project's main urls.py file.
  Your project's urls.py file should have something that looks like this:

    urlpatterns = [
        path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    ]

  The API maker has created an \"api\" directory with a urls.py file in it with generated api urls.
  You need to include the \"api/urls.py\" in your project's urls.py file, like so: 

    urlpatterns = [
        path('api/', include('api.urls'), name='api_urls'),
        path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    ]

Got to http://yourserver.name/api to view your api.
Enjoy!
